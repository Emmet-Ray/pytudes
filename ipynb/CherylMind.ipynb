    "# LLMs, Theory of Mind, and Cheryl's Birthday\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been [much](https://spectrum.ieee.org/theory-of-mind-ai) [debate](https://aclanthology.org/2023.conll-1.25/) [on](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/theory-mind-may-have-spontaneously-emerged-large-language-models) [the](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083) [degree](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01882-z) to which Large Language Models (LLMs) have a theory of mind: a way of understanding what other people know and don't know. In this notebook I explore one small part of the issue by asking six LLMs to solve the [Cheryl's Birthday Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_Birthday), a well-known logic puzzle in which different characters have different states of knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "**TLDR**:  The six LLMs were all familiar with the problem, so I didn't have to describe it in the prompt, just name it. They were able to correctly state that the answer to the problem is July 16. But none of them were able to write a program that finds the solution. They all failed to distinguish the different knowledge states of the different characters–for this problem they had no theory of mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I show the response for each LLM. I elided some of the explanatory output when it was very similar to previous output, but I show the programs verbatim. My comments are in *[bracketed italics]* and the LLM output is in regular upright text. The queries were made on Sept 25, 2024; subsequent updates of the models may perform differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each LLMs the prompt was:\n",
    "\n",
    "***What is the answer to the \"Cheryl's Birthday\" problem? Write a Python program to solve it. Make sure that the program will still work if the list of possible dates is changed.***"

    "*[ChatGPT 4o gives the following response, which starts with an excellent summary of the problem:]*\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Cheryl's Birthday\" problem is a well-known logic puzzle that can be solved using logical deduction. Let's first break down the problem before writing a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Cheryl gives Albert and Bernard a list of 10 possible birthdates, and tells them different information:\n",
    "- Albert knows the month.\n",
    "- Bernard knows the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheryl provides the following 10 possible dates:\n",
    "- May 15, May 16, May 19\n",
    "- June 17, June 18\n",
    "- July 14, July 16\n",
    "- August 14, August 15, August 17\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert then says: \"I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know either.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernard replies: \"At first I didn’t know when Cheryl's birthday is, but now I know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Albert then says: \"Now I know when Cheryl's birthday is.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Deduction\n",
    "1. From Albert's statement, we can deduce that Cheryl's birthday is not in May or June, because if it were, Bernard could possibly know the exact birthday if the day was unique (May 19 or June 18). Since Albert is sure Bernard doesn't know, we can eliminate May and June.\n",
    "2. After eliminating May and June, the remaining possible dates are:\n",
    "    - July 14, July 16\n",
    "    - August 14, August 15, August 17\n",
    "3. From Bernard’s statement, now knowing the birthday, we can deduce that Cheryl's birthday isn't on July 14 or August 14, because if it were, Bernard would still be uncertain (since both dates share the day 14).\n",
    "4. The remaining possible dates are:\n",
    "    - July 16\n",
    "    - August 15\n",
    "    - August 17\n",
    "5. Finally, from Albert’s statement, we deduce that Cheryl's birthday must be in July, because if it were in August, Albert wouldn’t be able to know the exact date. Thus, the birthday is July 16.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Program to Solve the Problem\n",
    "We can now write a Python program to generalize this solution and ensure it works for any list of possible dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- Step 1: The function groups the dates by month and by day.\n",
    "- Step 2: Based on Albert's statement, we eliminate the months of May and June.\n",
    "- Step 3: Based on Bernard's statement, we eliminate dates where the day appears more than once (i.e., both July 14 and August 14 are eliminated).\n",
    "- Step 4: Albert now knows Cheryl's birthday, so it must be in the month where only one date is left (i.e., July).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is designed to work with any given list of possible dates, not just the ones in the original problem."
